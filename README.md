# STAR2019 A Computational Model for Artificial Intelligence

The new model of computation, cybernetic automaton, was introduced by Dr. Stuart in his publication "An Alternative Computational Model for Artificial Intelligence" in 1992. With a view to mimicking learning activity of natural intelligence, this model emulates low-level learning of classical and intrumental conditioning. 

This work is to reconstruct the algorithm using Python and do several experiments to verify if the model results match other biological and psychological literature.
